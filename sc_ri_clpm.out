THE MODEL ESTIMATION TERMINATED NORMALLY

     THE MODEL CONTAINS A NON-ZERO CORRELATION BETWEEN DEPENDENT VARIABLES.
     SUCH CORRELATIONS ARE IGNORED IN THE COMPUTATION OF THE FACTOR SCORES.
     THE MODEL COVARIANCE MATRIX IS NOT POSITIVE DEFINITE.
     FACTOR SCORES WILL NOT BE COMPUTED. CHECK YOUR MODEL.
